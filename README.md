## This is a minimal set up to get going using the Lua or Fennel languages with Raylib.

- RayLua bindings https://github.com/Rabios/raylua
- Fennel https://fennel-lang.org/

Run the template using lua/luajit/fennel from the command line.

For example: 
`fennel ./basic-example.fnl`
`luajit ./basic-example.lua`

You will need to place a library file at the root of the project. (prebuilt binaries can be found at https://github.com/Rabios/raylua)

For example:
libraylib64.dll
libraylib32.dll
libraylib.dylib
libraylib.so
